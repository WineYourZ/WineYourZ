- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuzhu @WineYourZ
- 👀 I’m a wine geek who live in Bordeaux and studied in Burgundy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wine & Spirits Management in KEDGE Business School
- 💞️ I’m seeking for an opportunity of apprenticeship for my 2nd year of Master's degree
- 📫 Reach me by email at yuzhu.wang@kedgebs.com
- 😄 Pronoun: You can Yuzu me🍋...
- ⚡ Fun fact: Yuzu is a kind of lemon-like citrus fruit, widely used in the gastronomic world. Since French people don't pronounce "h" and my name is Yuzhu, I've become this lovely fruit since I moved in France !
